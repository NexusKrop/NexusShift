# NexusShift

NexusShift is a plugin for Paper servers that is tailored for our own CMP use.

It is designed to be used in servers with no more than 50 people, and does not run behind a proxy such as Velocity.

## Features

It provides numerous features that was implemented in data-packs prior to the founding of this plugin.

Most of the commands back then was implemented in this plugin but not all of them.

### Administration

This plugin is designed to be used in combination of 'LuckPerms' and 'CoreProtect', although did not use their API directly.

It's merely here for customization features and some anti-griefing stuff that we used in the old days for EnderShop, Green Creative & Relaper Stack stuff.

It also contains some idea from other services back then such as 'SMCCM51', but since that was not developed since, no more idea was added to this plugin from that.
